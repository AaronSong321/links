KNOWN ISSUES

 * Support for IE is limited.

 * The following web features have not yet been implemented.
   - URLs
   - Arbitrary HTTP headers, response codes
   - Accessibility standards

 * Linked stylesheets don't work (use embedded styles instead).

 * XML support is incomplete, e.g.:
   - Ill-formed XML can sometimes be accepted
   - CDATA literals are not accepted.
   - XML namespaces are not handled.
   - Non-ASCII characters are not handled.

 * The effect analysis used to determine whether something is
   convertible to a query fails to detect recursion that sneaks in via
   recursive types.  For example,

     query { (fun (x) { x.unroll(x)})
             ((unroll = (fun (x) { x.unroll(x) }))) }

   is accepted and loops for ever when infer_recursive_types is set to
   "guarded" (the default) or "all".

 * Switch expressions are not currently accepted in queries.  For
   example, the program

     query { switch(A) { case A -> [] } }

   causes Links to terminate abruptly at runtime.
