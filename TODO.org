* Incomplete list of current TODO items:

** DONE Relax the type system so that query blocks may return any value.
** DONE Try to use the ferrydb backend with PostgreSQL 8.4
** DONE Implement compilation of expressions with a nested type (e.g. lists of lists or records of lists)
*** DONE `Base -> `Any in Typesugar
*** DONE modify lalgebra compilation rules to handle itbls
** DONE Investigate the status of dense_rank and Common Table Expressions (CTE) in PostgreSQL.

** DONE make for-comprehensions with orderbys work again
** DONE make suse (inner table slicing) configurable

** DONE implement a database backend in line with ferrydb
*** DONE take a sql plan bundle from pfsql and execute it via the ocaml postgresql bindings
*** DONE collect the results of the individual sql queries
*** DONE reconstruct the links heap result as a Value.t according to the type of the query block

** TODO How to compile comparison operators (==, >, <>) when they are applied to non-primitive values (e.g. lists, records)?
*** TODO compile comparisons on records by comparing field by field
*** TODO restrict type of comparison operators so that comparisons on lists are not allowed in query blocks

** TODO Extend the Links syntax for table handles with a notation for key informations and guide these through the frontend.
** TODO Extend the Links syntax for comprehensions with a groupby statement in line with ferry/haskell.

** TODO Implement new (less strict) constraints for the return value of query blocks.

** TODO Implement missing Ferry/Links primitive functions
*** DONE zip/unzip
*** DONE nth
*** DONE take/drop
*** DONE length
*** DONE map/concatMap/asList (implicitly)
*** DONE hd/tl
*** DONE filter
*** DONE groupBy
*** TODO max/min/sum (almost done)
*** TODO pattern matching: tilde/ntilde/ltilde/lntilde/stilde/sntilde
*** TODO trigonometric functions: floor, ceiling, cos, sin, tan, log, sqrt
*** TODO the (prelude)
*** TODO concat (prelude)

** TODO nth should not fail if the list is too short. Return an 'a option instead.

** TODO All changes to primitive functions (new functions etc) in lib.ml must be implemented in Javascript as well (lib/js/jslib.js).
*** TODO zip
*** TODO unzip
*** TODO nth

** TODO implement groupWith in the prelude
** TODO find out difference between concatMap/map and simple recursive functions regarding effects

** TODO Find out how to handle some features of Links.
*** TODO XML 
*** TODO Variant tags

** TODO enable compilation of for-comprehensions with orderby-clauses again.

** TODO clean up, restructure and document the code (especially Heapresult)
** TODO write systematic test cases for the algebra compilation and the value reconstruction

** TODO known defects
*** TODO links-examples/empty.links as of 93bfc4554d
