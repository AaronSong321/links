write an Ord class
 (but it won't work well for mutable types.
  either we have to have no ordering for mutable types
  or give up the constraint that Ord.compare l r = 0 => Eq.eq l r)

perhaps hide generated type declarations inside the generated module.
   
can we generate faster code than sexplib?
