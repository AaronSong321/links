Typing `make' in this directory should build both the preprocessor
(syntax/deriving) and the libraries (lib/deriving.cma,
lib/deriving.cmxa).

You can run the tests by changing to the test directory and building
and running the `tests' executable

   $ cd tests
   $ make
   ...
   $ ./tests
   Tests succeeded!
